# JSnake

A boost-like package for Python .

There are two ways to install this:

1. Download a wheel if there is one, and do `pip3 install snek-<ver>-py3-none-any.whl`
   (`<ver>` is a placeholder for the project version).
2. Download the zip or clone this repository. Go into the root directory and do
   `pip3 install .`. This method depends on `flit`.
